Welcome! I am a Security Research Engineer in the <a
href="https://www.samsungknox.com/en">Samsung KNOX</a> security team at Samsung
Research America.  My broad interests are in computer systems and security. 

I obtained a PhD in Computer Science and Engineering at Penn State. My PhD
dissertation looked at programs' interaction with the system they are deployed
in, and how mismatches between program expectations of a system and the reality
in the system can affect security.  My PhD advisor was <a href =
"http://www.cse.psu.edu/~tjaeger"> Dr. Trent Jaeger</a>.  I also have worked on
infrastructures for providing transparent verification of the cloud, ARM
TrustZone-based kernel runtime monitoring, and analyzing security policies at
multiple layers for mediation and consistency properties. 

For more details, please see summaries below and my <a
href="publications.html"> publications </a> page.

<ul>
<li>
Our USENIX 2014 paper <i>JIGSAW: Protecting Resource Access by Inferring
Programmer Expectations</i> proposes a principled way to generate Process
Firewall rules to block resource access vulnerabilities. The intuition behind
rule generation is to infer programmer intentions using special \emph{filters}
they place in code to handle untrusted input and matching this intent with the
system configuration. A video of my presentation can be found <a
href=https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity14/technical-sessions/presentation/vijaykumar>
here</a>.  <br>

<li> 
Our Eurosys 2013 paper <i> Process Firewalls: Protecting Processes During
Resource Access </i> (<a href="files/papers/vsj_2013_eurosys.pdf">PDF</a>) proposes a
defense against attacks caused due to programs fetching improper resources from
the OS.  Resources are managed by the OS, but current system call APIs do not
allow programs to sufficiently express their constraints during resource
access.  In addition, current system call APIs for resource access are
complicated and inefficient. The Process Firewall is an extensible framework
(motivated by the network firewall) that uses rules to protect processes during
resource access. We show how the Process Firewall defends attacks without
requiring program code changes, and how it is more efficient than program
defenses. <br>

<li>
Our USENIX Security 2012 paper <i>STING: Finding Name Resolution
Vulnerabilities in Programs</i> (<a
href="files/papers/vsj_2012_usenixsec.pdf">PDF</a>) proposes a novel
system-based black-box testing approach to find name resolution
vulnerabilities in programs by simulating adversarial actions on the
namespace, based on the insight that the system is the vector for such
vulnerabilities.  A video of my presentation can be found <a
href=https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity12/sting-finding-name-resolution-vulnerabilities-programs>
here</a>. <br> 

<li>
Our  ASIACCS 2012 paper <i>Integrity Walls: Finding Attack Surfaces from
Mandatory Access Control Policies</i> (<a
href="files/papers/vjr_2012_asiaccs.pdf">PDF</a>) shows how accurate location
of attack surfaces of programs requires program entry points to be considered
in relation to system access control policies. <br>

<li>
Our EC2ND 2011 paper <i>A Rose by Any Other Name or an Insane Root? Adventures
in Name Resolution</i> (<a href="files/papers/vsj_2011_ec2nd.pdf">PDF</a>)
categorises attacks possible due to adversarial control of system namespaces
that are not expected by programs.
